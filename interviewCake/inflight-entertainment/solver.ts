/*
  Write a function that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes) and an array of integers movieLengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether there are two numbers in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.

  When building your function:

  Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
  Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
  Optimize for runtime over memory
